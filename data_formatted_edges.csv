Colleagues are being encouraged to download Myzone onto their personal devices. There are very detailed and specific T&C's when you register but I do wonder if people read these and do not therefore take enough care around passwords and visibility etc. KIT can be viewed on Myzone and I am just concerned that all our internal procedures are therefore visible.Could a regalr reminder be sent to colleagues who access Myzone on their own personal iPads and phones ? Also, if a colleague leaves Barclays, does their access to Myzone automatically get revoked ?

Its good to be informed of any important news before getting into the office but very often the posts in the Newszone come later in the day, when I have already seen the communication on the intranet or via email. It would be beneficial if any Newszone updates were done prior to 9am. The Myalerts feature is great but often there are alerts about other areas of the bank that I am not linked to (e.g Wealth). Although its nice to read what other departments are doing i feel the Myalerts space should be for my specific banking area news (e.g Business Banking). Also when something appears in Myalerts its only a very brief outline of the wider story, whereby the full article can be found by looking into on of the other Newszone features eg UK RBB News or Group News.
